## Project Overview
This website is a personal tribute to Sylvester Stallone.  

The website is designed with a responsive layout that allows visitors to explore his biography and photos, listen to his music playlist, like the website and scan QR code to enter the page. Additionally, there's a Q&A section that explains key differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3 technologies, and shows a specific usecase that helps to understand those differences.  
 
The website also includes a navigation bar that allows smooth movement between the site's different sections that are detailed below.

### Website Sections
- **About Me**: A short biography of Sylvester Stallone.
- **My Photos**: A collection of photos from Sylvester Stallone's career, showcasing famous people he met with, his family, and his childhood.
- **My Playlist**: A collection of embedded YouTube videos, featuring some music that he liked, with a little twist since youtube doesn't allow embedding for most of his related songs.
- **Like**: An interactive "Like" button that tracks the number of likes given by visitors and also a quick access like button to the Sylvester Stallone facebook page.
- **QR Code**: A section displaying a QR code for easy access to the website via mobile.
- **Q&A**: A comparison of Web1, Web2, and Web3 technologies, using a shawarma search as a fun use case to explain the differences.
- **Contact Me**: A form for visitors to contact me, with a selection of emojis that can be added to messages.
